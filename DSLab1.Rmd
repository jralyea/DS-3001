## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)

view(beaches)

#Beaches dataset
#Q1 - what is the difference of average rainfall between August 2013 and January 2018? 
###Pseudo Code Steps###
#1. group_by month and year
#2. filter for the respective years and months
#3. summarize for the mean rainfall in the filtered datasets
beaches25 <- beaches %>%
  na.omit(beaches) %>%
  group_by(month,year)
beaches1 <- filter(beaches,month=="8",year=="2013") %>%
  summarise(beaches1,mean(rainfall))
beaches2 <- filter(beaches,month=="1",year=="2018") %>%
  summarize(beaches2,mean(rainfall))
  #4.24 - 2.08 == 2.16 ****
  
beaches_rainfall <- function(){
    beaches %>%
    filter(month=="1",year=="2018") %>%
    select(rainfall) %>%
    summarize(beaches,sum18 <- mean("rainfall"),na.rm)

    beaches %>% 
    filter(month=="8",year=="2013") %>%
    select(rainfall) %>%
    summarize(beaches,sum13 <- mean("rainfall"))
return(c(sum18,sum13))
}

beaches_rainfall()
  
#__________________________________________________________

#Q2- what month in 2018 had the highest recorded temperature? 
###Pseudo Code Steps###
#1. filter out all non-2018 observations and any observations that do not contain a temp value. 
#2. group by month 
#3. Summarize max temperature
xbeach <- beaches %>%
  na.omit(beaches) %>%
  filter(year==2018) %>%
  group_by(year, month)%>%
  summarize(max.temp = max(tempature))

max_temp_2018 <- function(){
  xbeaches1 <-beaches %>%
  filter(year==2018) %>%
  group_by(year,month) %>%
  summarize(beaches,x<-max("tempature"))
  return(x)
}

#Wine dataset
  
#Q1 - what is the average residual sugar of a wine with quality of 8
###Pseudo Code Steps###
#1. Import wine data
#2. Employ a filter function to new database for observations with quality value of 8 for the filter
#3. Use summarize function to find mean of “residual sugar” for new database
  
  
 winequality_red <- read_delim("winequality-red.csv",
                                ";", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
 
 x<- winequality_red %>%
   select(quality) %>%
   filter(quality==8) %>%
summarize(x,mean("residual sugar"))

  x<- winequality_red %>%
    select(quality) %>%
    filter(quality==8) %>%
summarize(x,mean("residual sugar"))
  
}
sugar_func()
 

#Q2 - What are the top “total acid” values for all observations? 
#Pseudo Code Steps
#1. use select function and Starts_with function to locate all acid related columns 
#2. Utilize mutate function to create new column that adds first acid columns together
#3. Use arrange function and col to re-order the rows so that the highest total acid values are shown 
  
 winequality_red %>%
   select(ends_with("acid"), ends_with("dity")) %>%
   mutate(total_acid = `volatile acidity`+`citric acid`+`fixed acidity`) %>%
   arrange("total acid")
 
 
 wine_acid <- function(){
   x <- winequality_red %>%
     select(ends_with("acid"), ends_with("dity")) %>%
     mutate(total_acid = `volatile acidity`+`citric acid`+`fixed acidity`)
   max(x,"total_acid",na.rm = TRUE)

# Euro Energy Database

library(readr)
 EuroEnergy <- read_csv("EuroEnergy.csv")
 View(EuroEnergy)
 
#Q1 - What is the energy average of countries with gdp above the mean
#Pseudo Code Steps
#1. Utilize summarize function to determine mean of gdp 
#2. Filter for countries with gdp above the mean 
#3. Utilize summarize function to determine energy use mean of above avg. GDP countries

x <- EuroEnergy %>%
  na.omit(EuroEnergy) %>%
  summarise(EuroEnergy, eurogdpmean = mean(gdp, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(gdp >=eurogdpmean) %>%
  summarise(EuroEnergy,euroenergymean <- mean(energy))
  
  Energy_mean <- function(){
  w <- EuroEnergy %>%
    select(gdp,energy) %>%
    filter(gdp > mean(gdp))
  return(summarise(w,mean(energy)))
  }
Energy_mean()


##Q2 Does West Germany consume more units of energy (per 10000 people) relative to their GDP than Italy does with its own respective GDP and energy use? 
#1. Filter the data for West Germany and Italy
#2. Utilize mutate function to create new energy/10000 column 
#3. Utilize mutate function to generate energy to gdp ratios and compare
 EuroEnergy1 <- EuroEnergy %>%
   select(X1,gdp,energy) %>%
   filter(X1 %in% c("WGermany","Italy"))%>%
   mutate(ratio_10k = energy/(gdp/10000))
   #West Germany#
 
gdpratio_by_10k <- function(){
  gdpratiofunc <- EuroEnergy %>%
   select(X1,gdp,energy) %>%
   filter(X1 %in% c("WGermany","Italy"))
   E2 <-mutate(EuroEnergy,ratio_10k = energy/(gdp/10000))
   return(E2)
}

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
